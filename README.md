# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. git clone https://github.com/devstepbcn/RNBG_test_case.git
2. cd RNBG_test_case
3. npm i
4. react-native run-ios --configuration Release  (I think the error happens more often in release mode)
5. Press the start / stop button repeatedly until the application freezes. 

NOTE: Sometimes it takes a little longer and others less. Sometimes the application works as expected then it must be restarted until it happens. It happens on a real device also.
